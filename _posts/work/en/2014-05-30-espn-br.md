about: ESPN Brasil's portal development, one of Brazil's biggest cable television sports channel. With a responsive version, it solved several problems with this user group, as they couldn't access the portal from a mobile device.

status: Project is live and being used by sports fans, breaking audience records in the first months after launch.

what_has_been_done: Being the great portal it is, the idea was to replace pages one by one so the final users wouldn't feel the change. The portal, today, has 100% support for mobile devices.
