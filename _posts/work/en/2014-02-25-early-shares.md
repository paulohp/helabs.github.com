about: Early Shares is an online equity crowd-funding service that turns anyone into an investor by connecting them with business owners looking to fund and sell a stake of their company.

status: The project is launched and has an active user base.

what_has_been_done: We worked on this project for one year. Now, it's being maintained by the client's own team. Another great example of a client starting out and growing for the first year with us. 

customer_experience: My experience with HE:labs was great and the project was a huge success. What you guys did and your skills in web development make any task seem easy, which is amazing when dealing with web development companies. That is pretty impressive for all standards.
