          <span>One of our big specialties is integrating systems. </span>When ESPN Brazil, a giant in
          sports journalism, approached us to build their first mobile portal, it was a
          a huge chance to write some history. We ended up developing and integrating an entirely new mobile application within their existing CMS system in record time.

          <p>Already on the first week's iteration, we created a functional version of the site
          and developed a web service to exchange information, like data and files, between
          the different systems.</p>

        <p>After 3 weeks of work, there were two complete solutions deployed to production supporting millions of visitors simultaneously, with no client IT involvement.</p>

        <p>The web service also had a great benefit: it ended up turning into a commercial solution
        for distributing content to other devices, like smart-TVs.</p>

        <p>We had also considered adding responsive design to automatically adjust the different media formats like text, audio, image or video.</p>

        <p>So what's the net gain for contracting an agile team?</p>
        <p>For this project, continuous improvement and self-organization between the team helped optimize time and anticipate product vision and features. For example: on the next iteration, we already had planned to support Firefox OS, and responsive design.</p>

          It's no wonder why we vouch for client and team happiness and lean deliveries that work perfectly.
